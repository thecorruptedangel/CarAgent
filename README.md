# CarAgent
This program enables users to schedule car servicing appointments via voice calls, integrating with Twilio or GSM hardware. It employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with ChromaDB for context-aware responses based on service manuals. The agent collects essential details and exports the information to Excel after each call.
